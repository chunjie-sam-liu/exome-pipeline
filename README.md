#Whole exome pipeline
The whole pipeline structure was upload to our bbs, you can search wes on bbs to find detailed specification and manual.
Or you may visit my WP, search chunjie-sam-liu on wordpress or on github.
Or run command ./test.sh to get intuitive result.

#Notice
The WEx pipeline is flexibale, you can put script into the script directory, and add the path into the config file.
The config file contains all data, software and script you use in the pipeline, you can do the analysis for diferent species if you add the coresponding reference to the config and software.
The results format liujy|liumg required are not integrated into the pipeline, it's deferent from the old version, the script can be add if necessary.
